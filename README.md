# [DEPRECATED] Zilswap Token List

**USAGE DEPRECATED: Zilswap now uses [ZilStream](https://zilstream.com) API for fetching token information and [ViewBlock](https://viewblock.io)'s logo database for loading token icons. Please use update these sources to have your token information reflected on Zilswap.**

~~This token list is used by the [Zilswap UI](https://zilswap.io).~~

~~## Adding your token~~

~~Submit a pull request with the following changes:~~

~~- Your token address keyed by a unique token symbol in `tokens.json`.~~
~~- A 64x64 svg logo with the filename as `<token_symbol>.svg` in the `/logos` folder.~~

~~In the pull request description, please include:~~

~~- The project's home page / web domain.~~
~~- A URL to a publicly accessible document (within your project's domain), that allows verification of the token address.~~
